<!-- Early Life -->

Shai was born to a Tunisian father and a Moroccan mother and spent his childhood in the city of Haifa (Israel).
He first discovered the music of hip-hop on "The Voice of Peace", a pirate radio station broadcasting from a hidden location in the Mediterranean Ocean. This combined with his father's ecelectic musical taste during these early days helped shape the unique style he would embody later on in life.
When he was 12 years old, his family emigrated to Montreal, Canada to start a new life.The change was particularly difficult for Shai as he had no choice but to evolve and adapt to a new culture and learn new languages. But the biggest change was one of racism and anti-semitism, something he had previously been insulated from. These experiences would later go on to shape his lyrical content.
While in high school, he became exposed to hip-hop again. But this time, it wasn't just the music, it was the culture as a whole. The clothing, the slang, dances, everything. He finally found something he could hold onto and not feel like an outsider.
Shai so badly wanted to understand the stories and the words that artfully flowed with the beats that, he became engrossed in it all and began using the music to help practice and eventually master English. He would listen and study with every album he could find.

<!-- Early Career -->

Not wanting to just listen to the music, Shai went out on a quest to start creating it as well and started going to open mic nights and practicing in freestyle cyphers. It was here, under the mentorship of the best rappers in Canada that he developed his skills and learned his craft.
In the late 90's he started making a name for himself garnering both underground and mainstream acclaim from his unique beats and captivating lyrics telling the story of his life.
Throughout all this, he remained grounded, taking on the name Supreme Hebrew Intelekt (SHI) as a representation of not only who he is, but where he came from.

<!-- Return to Israel -->

After polishing his skills on the streets of Montreal, Shai decided to make a return home to Israel. There, he discovered the hip-hop movement had not yet arrived. So he set out to bring his love of the music and culture to the people.
Back in Canada, Shai's raps were spoken in English and French. In Israel however, he had to evolve and adapt once again by learning how to rap in Hebrew. He also had the opportunity to experiment more with his songs, adding Middle Eastern melodies and writing about the local societal issues of Israel.
In honor of his return to Israel, Shai added the 360 to the symbolize his journey of coming back around "full-circle".
