<!-- === Life and Career === -->

Born to North-African parents in the city of Haifa(Israel), Shai spent his childhood there until his family emigrated to Montreal, Canada when he was 12. He faced many many challenges in Canada where, he did not speak the language or understand the culture. He was also confronted with racism and Anti-Semitism for the first time.

While in high school he became very interested in the Hip Hop scene and began listening to and memorizing songs as a way to help him improve his English. He soon discovered that he had a talent for Rapping and began performing publicly at open mic contests and with groups of friends.

He decided to pick the stage name SHI, short for Supreme Hebrew Intelekt, to be symbolic of his cultural roots. He would later add the numbers 360 to symbolize his return to Israel and coming "full-circle".

In 2001, Shai decided to return home to Israel. The Hip Hop scene in Israel was still in it's infancy and Shai made the decision to be apart of the growing industry. In order to be able to reach his audiences better, he decided to teach himself how to rap in Hebrew. As a pioneer in the Israeli Hip Hop scene, Shai was quickly rising to fame. During this rise, Shai released the first Israeli Hip Hop Mixtape (360 Degrees In The Shade) and hosted a popular radio show in Israel called The Lab.

Due to a heart condition and the multiple surgeries it required, he was unable to perform in front of live audiences. Shortly after the recovery of his final heart surgery, Shai released the albun "chai"(alive). It quickly became a huge success and he has since, received several Gold and Platinum Albums.

As a trilingual performer, Shai often attempts to leverage the unique wide ranging diversity of his audience in an effort to combat social injustices and promote peace and bridge the gap between cultures and communities.
