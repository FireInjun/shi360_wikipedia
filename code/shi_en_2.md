'''Shai Haddad''', better known by his stage name '''SHI 360''', was born {{date|19|july|1976}}, and is a Israeli-Canadian Rapper, DJ, and Music Producer. He is fully fluent and performs his music in English, French, and Hebrew.

== Biography ==

=== Early Life ===

Shai was born to a Tunisian father and a Moroccan mother and spent his childhood in the city of Haifa (Israel).
He first discovered the music of hip-hop on "The Voice of Peace", a pirate radio station broadcasting from a hidden location in the Mediterranean Ocean. This combined with his father's ecelectic musical taste during these early days helped shape the unique style he would embody later on in life.
When he was 12 years old, his family emigrated to Montreal, Canada to start a new life.The change was particularly difficult for Shai as he had no choice but to evolve and adapt to a new culture and learn new languages. But the biggest change was one of racism and anti-semitism, something he had previously been insulated from. These experiences would later go on to shape his lyrical content.
While in high school, he became exposed to hip-hop again. But this time, it wasn't just the music, it was the culture as a whole. The clothing, the slang, dances, everything. He finally found something he could hold onto and not feel like an outsider.
Shai so badly wanted to understand the stories and the words that artfully flowed with the beats that, he became engrossed in it all and began using the music to help practice and eventually master English. He would listen and study with every album he could find.

=== Early Career ===

Not wanting to just listen to the music, Shai went out on a quest to start creating it as well and started going to open mic nights and practicing in freestyle cyphers. It was here, under the mentorship of the best rappers in Canada that he developed his skills and learned his craft.
In the late 90's he started making a name for himself garnering both underground and mainstream acclaim from his unique beats and captivating lyrics telling the story of his life.
Throughout all this, he remained grounded, taking on the name Supreme Hebrew Intelekt (SHI) as a representation of not only who he is, but where he came from.

=== Return to Israel and Rise to Fame ===

After polishing his skills on the streets of Montreal, Shai decided to make a return home to Israel. There, he discovered the hip-hop movement had not yet arrived. So he set out to bring his love of the music and culture to the people.
Back in Canada, Shai's raps were spoken in English and French. In Israel however, he had to evolve and adapt once again by learning how to rap in Hebrew. Now in his home country, with a new name (SHI 360, adding the 360 to symbolize his "coming full-circle" back home to Israel), he took the scene by storm. Blending the Middle Eastern melodies of his youth and the language of his mother tongue with the skillful delivery and witty wordplay, SHI 360 quickly became an important figure in the Israeli hip-hop scene. Collaborating with the T.A.C.T. family of artists, Shai was earning gold and platinum status albums before his own solo work was complete.

=== Solo Album to Now ===

During the rapid rise to stardom, SHI 360 was unable to perform for a live audience due to a heart condition. After recovering from his final surgery he was finally able to focus enough to release his first solo Hebrew language album "Chai" (alive). It was an overnight success and several singles were top-rated on Israeli radio and TV.
Uniquely capable of being able to rap in English, French, and Hebrew, Shai's music is seen as being able to bring different groups of people together in a way that previously had never been able. He continues to embody a message of cooperation and positivity in his music and in his life.
