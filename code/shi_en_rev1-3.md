== Life and Career ==

Born to North-African parents in the city of [[Haifa]]([[Israel]]),<ref name=jpost /><ref name=sxsw /> Shai spent his childhood there until he family emigrated to [[Montreal]]([[Canada]]) when he was 12. He faced many many challenges in [[Canada]] where, he did not speak the language or understand the culture. He was also confronted with [[racism]] and [[antisemitism]] for the first time.

While in high school he became very interested in the [[Hip Hop]] scene and began listening to and memorizing songs as a way to help him improve his English.<ref name=algemeiner /><ref name=sxsw /> He soon discovered that he had a talent for [[rapping]] and began performing publicly at open mic contests and with groups of friends.

He decided to pick the stage name '''SHI''', short for Supreme Hebrew Intelekt<ref name=sxsw />, be symbolic of his cultural roots. He would later add the numbers '''360''' to symbolize his return to [[Israel]] and coming "full-circle".<ref name=sxsw /><ref name=jpost />

In 2001, Shai decided to return home to Israel.<ref name=sxsw /><ref name=jpost /> The Hip Hop scene in Israel was still in it's infancy and Shai made the decision to help grow it. In order to be able to reach his audiences better, he decided to teach himself how to rap in [[Hebrew]].<ref name=sxsw /> As a pioneer in the Israeli Hip Hop scene, Shai was quickly rising to fame. During this rise, Shai released the first Israeli Hip Hop Mixtape (''360 Degrees In The Shade'') and hosted a popular radio show in Israel called (''The Lab'').<ref name=sxsw />

Due to a heart condition and the multiple surgeries it required, he was unable to perform in front of live audiences.<ref name=sxsw /><ref name=jpost /> Shortly after the recovery of his final heart surgery, Shai released the album ''Chai''(alive). It quickly became a huge success and he has since earned several Gold and Platinum Albums.

Shai is often portrayed as a controversial and political artist because as a tri-lingual performer, he attempts to leverage the unique wide ranging of diversity of his audience to combat social injustices and promote peace and bridge the gap between cultures and communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/food/2013-03-11/roi-community-brings-jewish-change-makers-to-south-by-southwest|title=ROI Community Brings Jewish Change Makers to South by Southwest|website=www.austinchronicle.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref><ref name =israelnationalnews />
