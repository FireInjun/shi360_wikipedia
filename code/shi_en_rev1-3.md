'''Shai Haddad''' (born 19 July 1976), better known by his stage name '''SHI 360''', is a Israeli-Canadian rapper, DJ, and music producer.<ref name=jpost>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Do-you-know-real-hip-hop|title=Do you know real hip-hop? - Jewish World - Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>

=== Early Life ===

Shai was born to a Tunisian father and a Moroccan mother and spent his childhood in the city of Haifa (Israel).
He first discovered the music of hip-hop on "The Voice of Peace", a pirate radio station broadcasting from a hidden location in the Mediterranean Ocean.<ref name=algemeiner>{{Cite web|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2012/01/24/shalom-haters-interview-with-israelinorth-african-mc-shi-360|title=Interview with Israeli/North African MC SHI 360 - algemeiner|website=www.algemeiner.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>
e but to evolve and adapt to a new culture and learn new languages. But the biggest change was one of racism and anti-semitism<ref name=jpost />, something he had previously been insulated from. These experiences would later go on to shape his lyrical content.<ref name=jpost />
While in high school, he became exposed to hip-hop again. But this time, it wasn't just the music, it was the culture as a whole.<ref name=sxsw>{{Cite web|url=https://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_MS36024|title=SHI 360 event page|website=www.sxsw.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>
all and began using the music to help practice and eventually master English. He would listen and study with every album he could find.

=== Early Career ===

Not wanting to just listen to the music, Shai went out on a quest to start creating it as well and started going to open mic nights and practicing in freestyle cyphers.<ref name=sxsw /> It was here, under the mentorship of the best rappers in Canada that he developed his skills and learned his craft.
In the late 90's he started making a name for himself garnering both underground and mainstream acclaim from his unique beats and captivating lyrics telling the story of his life.
Throughout all this, he remained grounded, taking on the name Supreme Hebrew Intelekt (SHI) as a representation of not only who he is, but where he came from.<ref name=sxsw />

=== Return to Israel and Rise to Fame ===

After polishing his skills on the streets of Montreal, Shai decided to make a return home to Israel.<ref name=israelnationalnews>{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/152964|title=Rapper SHI 360 Defends Israel on Campus, in Media - Music and Entertainment - Israel International News|website=www.israelnationalnews.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>
nd adapt once again by learning how to rap in Hebrew. Now in his home country, with a new name (SHI 360, adding the 360 to symbolize his "coming full-circle" back home to Israel),<ref name=sxsw /> he took the scene by storm. Blending the Middle Eastern melodies of his youth and the language of his mother tongue with the skillful delivery and witty wordplay, SHI 360 quickly became an important figure in the Israeli hip-hop scene. Collaborating with the T.A.C.T. family of artists, Shai was earning gold and platinum status albums before his own solo work was complete.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1094347-Shi-360?filter_anv=0&type=Credits|title=discography|website=www.discogs.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref><ref name=sxsw />

=== Solo Album to Now ===

During the rapid rise to stardom, SHI 360 was unable to perform for a live audience due to a heart condition.<ref name=sxsw /> After recovering from his final surgery he was finally able to focus enough to release his first solo Hebrew language album "Chai" (alive). It was an overnight success and several singles were top-rated on Israeli radio and TV.
Uniquely capable of being able to rap in English, French, and Hebrew, Shai's music is seen as being able to bring different groups of people together in a way that previously had never been able. He continues to embody a message of cooperation and positivity in his music and in his life.<ref name=austinchronicle>{{Cite web|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/food/2013-03-11/roi-community-brings-jewish-change-makers-to-south-by-southwest|title=ROI Community Brings Jewish Change Makers to South by Southwest|website=www.austinchronicle.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>
